# ============================================================

model:
  type: "catboost"
  task_mode: "binary"      # Defines the task as binary classification
  loss_function: "Logloss" # Standard loss function for binary targets
  eval_metric: "AUC"       # Area Under Curve is robust for binary classification evaluation

system:
  # CatBoost on Mac (M-series) runs fastest on CPU. 
  # GPU support is generally optimized for NVIDIA CUDA.
  task_type: "CPU"
  thread_count: -1         # Use all available CPU cores

training:
  # Total number of boosting iterations (trees).
  # CatBoost is robust to overfitting, so higher numbers (e.g., 1000-2000) are safe with early stopping.
  iterations: 1000

  # Step size shrinkage used in update to prevents overfitting.
  # Lower values (0.01 - 0.1) require more iterations but generally yield better accuracy.
  learning_rate: 0.05

  # Depth of the trees. 
  # Values between 6 and 10 are standard. Higher values capture more complex patterns but are slower.
  depth: 6

  # L2 regularization coefficient on leaf values.
  # Higher values reduce overfitting.
  l2_leaf_reg: 3

  # Stop training if the evaluation metric (AUC) doesn't improve for 50 rounds.
  early_stopping_rounds: 50
  
  # Print training progress every 100 iterations.
  verbose: 100

  # Handles class imbalance automatically (useful if Benign >> Attack).
  # Options: "None", "Balanced", "SqrtBalanced"
  auto_class_weights: "Balanced"

  # Directory where the trained CatBoost model (.cbm) will be saved
